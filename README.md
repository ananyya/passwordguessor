# passwordguessor
guesses the password


This is a basic program which uses brute force principle, which is an attack to crack passwords where we submit many passwords guessing that any of the passwords which we are submitting may work.
So, we are applying brute force attack here with the help of while loop in python.
On running of the program, while loop will print a random password every time on execution until the password entered by the user matches the guess of our program.
This is just a basic project so giving a small password as input will be useful for more better understanding.nput of large project will also work but it will take time as the code is using simple while loop only.
